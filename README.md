## What and why?
Many students find it relatively difficult to memorise their University timetable as it varies from semester to semester and sometimes from week to week. With the proliferation of double degrees and minors, students often find themselves taking a variety of papers and aren’t part of a habit forming cohort. They are unable to rely on a single group to know where to go next. What a dilemma. Parallel to this, accessing one’s timetable through the University’s eVision system is cumbersome, time consuming and delivers a poor user experience on a mobile device. To add insult to injury, there is no feature that allows students to receive notifications for upcoming classes, tests or tutorials, or to export these engagements to a calendar app.
Intuitively, we knew we’d use an app that solves these problems every week, if not every day - however, we wanted to understand exactly what attributes or functionalities were important to make this app appealing to students at large.
To better understand the approaches that students use to manage their class timetables, we spoke to a number of them and compiled some common approaches and their relative drawbacks.
